      Seems like the recent generation<i> Gen-Z and millennials</i> are back to
      the "Good Old Days."
    </p>
    <p>
      The recent generations' fashion sense seems to be in line with the 70's
      folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baggy dressing,large shirts if not oversized and flaggy trousers and jeans
      seem to be the trend for "today's" style.
    </p>
    <p>How has dressing like your dad become the latest fashion?</p>
